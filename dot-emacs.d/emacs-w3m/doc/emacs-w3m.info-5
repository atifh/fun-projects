Getting web page and header information
---------------------------------------

Let's identify a target web page URL to gather subjects and other
informations first.  If a web site uses a frame, a target is only one
of the web pages.  Second, lets create a body of the
`shimbun-index-url' method function using the `luna-define-method'
form in your `sb-foobar.el' file.  And make the user customizable
variable `shimbun-foobar-groups', which we will explain later (1)
(*Note Getting web page and header information-Footnotes::).

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-url "http://www.foobar.net")

     (luna-define-method shimbun-index-url ((shimbun shimbun-foobar))
       shimbun-foobar-url)

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-groups '("news"))

After you create a body of the `shimbun-index-url' method, the
`shimbun-headers' method can get a web page source since the
`shimbun.el' module already has the default `shimbun-headers'
method.  After the `shimbun-headers' method gets a web page source,
it calls the `shimbun-get-headers' method to gather headers
information.  As the `shimbun.el' module does not have the
`shimbun-get-headers' method, you have to create it in your
`sb-foobar.el' file.

Now look carefully in the page source and create the
`shimbun-get-headers' method in your `sb-foobar.el' file.

Create a regular expression that can gather headers information.
Minimally necessary information are subject, date, author, URL and
`message-id' of an article.  They are used in MUA as Subject, Date,
From, Xref and Message-ID.

If you want to make an article from a line in a web page source, like:

     <a href="053003.html">some talks on May 30(posted by Mikio &lt;foo@bar.net&gt;)</a>

@noindent

use the following regexp:

     "<a href=\"\\(\\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\\)[0-9][0-9]\\.html\\)\">\\([^<(]+\\)(posted by \\([^<]+\\))<\/a>"

You can get a value for Xref by
`(match-string 1)'.  You can get a value for Date by modifying
a value of
`(match-string 2)'.  Subject by
`(match-string 3)' and From from
`(match-string 4)'.  You can modify them further for showing
additional information in MUA.

If URL of an article is a relative path like above, use
`shimbun-expand-url' to expand it before putting information to
header.  If each article doesn't have a each unique URLs (i.e. URL of
headers and URL of articles are just same), you have to ask Emacs to
remember body of an article when gathering headers information, For more
detail see the files `sb-palmfan.el', `sb-dennou.el' and
`sb-tcup.el'.

Sometimes you cannot identify Date information when gathering headers
information only from a web page source.  If so, leave it, just set a
null string, `""' to its value.  If you can identify Date only when
you see contents of an article, you can set it at that time by using
`shimbun-make-contents' method.  And you may use a fixed From for a
web site (e.x. "webmaster@foobar.net").

Be careful when you build a message-id.  Make sure it has uniqueness
otherwise you may not be able to read some articles in the `shimbun'
(2) (*Note Getting web page and header information-Footnotes::).
Assure uniqueness by building message-id using date information, a
domain of the page and/or a part of URL of the page.  And use `@' but
`:' as a part of message-id in order to display inline images.  See
RFC2387 and RFC822 for more detail.

Put these information to header using function
`shimbun-create-header' of the `shimbun.el' module.

A bare bone of `shimbun-get-headers' in your `sb-foobar.el' file is as
follows:

     (luna-define-method shimbun-get-headers ((shimbun shimbun-foobar)
					      &optional range)
       (let ((regexp "....")
	     subject from date id url headers)
	 ...
	 (catch 'stop
	   (while (re-search-forward regexp nil t nil)
	     ...
	     (when (shimbun-search-id shimbun id)
	       (throw 'stop nil))
	     (push (shimbun-create-header
		    0 subject from date id "" 0 0 url)
		   headers)))
	 headers))

Note that you can access `shimbun-foobar' instance via temporary
variable `shimbun' in the method.

Now we will explain a user variable `shimbun-foobar-groups'.

Assume that you have two groups of articles in
`http://www.foobar.net' and there are two different web pages
for such groups in where `shimbun' module gathers header
information.  For examples, there are what's new information of the web
site in
`http://www.foobar.net/whatsnew/index.hmtl', and there are
archive lists of email messages posted to ML in
`http://www.foobar.net/ml/index.html'.  In such case you may
want to access the group by `shimbun' folders
`foobar.whatsnew' and `foobar.ml'.  If so, put the following S
expressions to the `sb-foobar.el' file.

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-url "http://www.foobar.net")

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist
       '(("whatsnew" . "/whatsnew/index.html")
	 ("ml" . "/ml/index.html")))

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-groups
       (mapcar 'car shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist))

     (luna-define-method shimbun-index-url ((shimbun shimbun-foobar))
       (concat shimbun-foobar-url
	       (cdr (assoc (shimbun-current-group-internal shimbun)
			   shimbun-foobar-group-path-alist))))

You can get the current group by using
`shimbun-current-group-internal'.  You can use it in
`shimbun-get-headers' method (or others) in order to change its
behavior in accordance with the current group.

Each `shimbun' module needs at least one group.  There is not a
special rule for naming a group, but if you don't find out a good
name, use `news' or `main'.


File: emacs-w3m.info  Node: Getting web page and header information-Footnotes, Up: Getting web page and header information

(1) At least one group is necessary for each `shimbun' module
even if you don't want it.

(2) And more, you may not be able to read actual email messages from
someone when message-ids conflict!

Displaying an article
---------------------

`shimbun-article' method defined in the `shimbun.el' module gets URL
from Xref information of header, get a web page source from the URL,
and call `shimbun-make-contents' in working buffer of the source.
Major job of `shimbun-make-contents' is to process such HTML.  Imagine
that a working buffer has a web page source of an article.
`shimbun-make-contents' defined in the `shimbun.el' module insert (i)
header information to top of the buffer, (ii) `<html>', `<body>' and
etc. right after the information, and (iii) `</body>' and `</html>' to
end of the buffer.  MUA displays an article as a HTML mail.

     Not only HTML articles, but also articles in the `text/plain'
     format can be generated.  *Note Making text/plain articles::.

If you don't want to process an article, you don't have to define
`shimbun-make-contents' in the `sb-foobar.el' module.

If you want to remove some part of a web page source of an article at
its top and its end, set regexp to `shimbun-foobar-content-start' that
matches content start and `shimbun-foobar-content-end' that matches
content end.

     (defvar shimbun-foobar-content-start "^<body>$")
     (defvar shimbun-foobar-content-end "^<\/body>$")

`shimbun-clear-contents', which is called by `shimbun-make-contents'
defined in the `shimbun.el' module, will remove HTML source from
`point-min' to `shimbun-foobar-content-start' and from
`shimbun-foobar-content-end' to `point-max' using the regexps.  Note
that it will not remove any HTML source when either of the regexp
searches fails.

If you want to remove more unnecessary parts (e.x. advertisements)
diligently, define `shimbun-clear-contents' in your new
`sb-foobar.el' file as follows:

     (luna-define-method shimbun-clear-contents :around ((shimbun shimbun-foobar)
							 header)
       ;; cleaning up
       (while (re-search-forward "..." nil t nil)
	 (delete-region (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
       (luna-call-next-method))

For more details see `shimbun-make-contents' in the
`sb-ibm-dev.el' file.

I said in the subsection of *Note Getting web page and header information:: that if each article doesn't have a each unique URLs you
have to ask Emacs to remember body of an article when gathering headers
information,  In such case you don't have to get a web page from URL of
Xref in `shimbun-article' method.  Just get texts from Emacs
memories and put them with pretty printing.  For more detail see
definitions of `shimbun-article' method of `sb-palmfan.el',
`sb-dennou.el' or `sb-tcup.el'.

Inheriting shimbun module
-------------------------

There are some famous mailing list manager (or archiver).

   * Mailman
     The GNU Mailing List Manager, formerly called as `pipermail'.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html' for detail.

   * MHonArc See `http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html' for
     detail.

   * fml
     fml mailing list server/manager.  See
     `http://www.fml.org/software/fml/' for detail.

   * mailarc See `http://cvs.namazu.org/mailarc/' for detail.

If you find out one of such mailing list managers' names in a web page
source when you analyze it in the step of *Note Getting web page and
header information::, you are very lucky (1) (*Note Inheriting shimbun
module-Footnotes::).  The modules `sb-mailman.el',
`sb-mhonarc.el', `sb-fml.el' and `sb-mailarc.el' have
the `shimbun-get-headers' method, etc, already, when you write
small code that is not defined in such `shimbun' modules, your
new `sb-foobar.el' module works!

If you use the `sb-mailman.el' module, write the following S
expressions to the top of the `sb-foobar.el' file:

     (require 'sb-mailman)
     (luna-define-class shimbun-foobar (shimbun-mailman) ())

Those above mean that `shimbun' module `shimbun-foobar' inherits
shimbun-mailman class (2) (*Note Inheriting shimbun
module-Footnotes::) and methods defined in the `sb-mailman.el' module
will be used in `shimbun-foobar' by default.  You can overwrite some
of parent methods, if necessary.

See the `sb-pilot-mailsync.el' file as a sample that uses the
`sb-mailman.el' module.  You can feel how easy to create a new
`shimbun' module by using such parent modules.

Note that there are some localized version of such mailing list
manager, for examples, some of them show Date information in Japanese.
The modules `sb-mailman.el', `sb-mhonarc.el', `sb-fml.el' and
`sb-mailarc.el' assumes that mailing list managers are not localized.

If you want to read via `shimbun' a web site that uses localized
mailing list manager, you may have to overwrite some methods in the
parent module.


File: emacs-w3m.info  Node: Inheriting shimbun module-Footnotes, Up: Inheriting shimbun module

(1) Such mailing list managers often show their own name in an archive
list page

(2) i.e. shimbun-mailman class is a parent class.

Making text/plain articles
--------------------------

Even if the MUA is reinforced by emacs-w3m so as to be able to read
HTML articles, `text/plain' articles might be more convenient in some
cases.  To make the `sb-foobar' module generate `text/plain' articles
rather than `text/html' articles, there are two ways to do that.

   * The one is to make the `sb-foobar' module inherit (*Note
     Inheriting shimbun module::) the `sb-text' module.  Here's an
     example you may put in the beginning of the `sb-foobar' module.

	  (require 'sb-text)
	  (luna-define-class shimbun-foobar (shimbun-text) ())

     The `sb-text' module provides the `shimbun-make-contents' method
     which generates the articles in the `text/plain' format.  This
     will be useful for the `shimbun' modules handling the web sites
     which put up only text articles.

   * The other is to set the `shimbun-foobar-prefer-text-plain' variable
     to non-`nil'.  This makes the `shimbun-make-contents' method
     generate the articles in the `text/plain' format (actually, it uses
     the functions provided by the `sb-text' module).  Note that this is
     effective only to the modules which inherit the default
     `shimbun-make-contents' method (especially the modules which
     inherit the `sb-text' module are not affected).  The advantage of
     this way is that users can easily switch `text/plain' articles and
     `text/html' articles.

     The default value for the `shimbun-foobar-prefer-text-plain'
     variable is `nil' if it is not defined.  So, it defaults to
     `nil' in every `shimbun' module except for the modules
     `sb-asahi.el' and `sb-yomiuri.el'.

     In addition, you can use the variables
     `shimbun-foobar-text-content-start' and
     `shimbun-foobar-text-content-end' instead of
     `shimbun-foobar-content-start' and `shimbun-foobar-content-end'
     to extract significant text in web pages (*Note Displaying an
     article::).  If the formers are not defined, those values default
     to the latter values.

Whichever the ways you use, you should note that the `text/plain'
articles cannot contain images, links, etc.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Zenkaku to hankaku conversion, Next: Coding convention of Shimbun, Prev: Making text/plain articles, Up: Shimbun Basics

Zenkaku to hankaku conversion
-----------------------------

"Zenkaku" or "zenkaku character(s)" is a term commonly used to call
Japanese wide characters, and "hankaku" is an opposite term for
ordinary ASCII characters.  There is a complete set of zenkaku
characters corresponding to at least the ASCII character set.

Some Japanese web sites tend to use zenkaku characters a lot, and
those articles might not necessarily be comfortable to read.  If you
feel so, you can use this feature that converts those zenkaku ASCII
characters into hankaku.  To do that, set the
`shimbun-foobar-japanese-hankaku' variable to `t'.  Where `foobar' is
a server name to which you subscribe for shimbun articles.  That is,
you have to use it per server.

If you prefer to convert zenkaku to hankaku only in the body of
articles, use the value `body' instead of `t'.  Contrarily the value
`header' or `subject' specifies to perform it only in subjects.



File: emacs-w3m.info, Node: Coding convention of Shimbun, Prev: Zenkaku to hankaku conversion, Up: Shimbun Basics

Coding convention of Shimbun
----------------------------

   * You can use all functions defined in emacs-w3m in `shimbun.el'.

   * You can use no functions defined in emacs-w3m in `sb-*.el'.  If
     you want to use emacs-w3m functions in `sb-*.el', you must add
     their stubs to `shimbun.el'.

   * You must avoid file names that have already used in SpeedBar.
     Here is a list of file names used in `speedbar-0.14beta4'.

     sb-ant.el     sb-html.el    sb-info.el    sb-texinfo.el
     sb-gud.el     sb-image.el   sb-rmail.el   sb-w3.el

   * You should select file names which remind their referring WEB
     servers' URIs.  It is allowed to remove country parts
     (Ex. jp,de,uk,etc), organization parts (Ex. edu,com,org,net,etc)
     and redundant parts (Ex. www) if removing does not increase
     vagueness.

   * You should select group names in USENET style.  It means that
     small characters are preferred in group names, and that period(.)
     is preferred as an delimiter to show hierarchical structure in
     groups.

Some knick-knacks using emacs-w3m
*********************************

Here are some handy tips to use emacs-w3m with other Emacs facilities.

   * browse-url

     You can use emacs-w3m with the `browse-url' feature.  For
     instance, put the following lines in your `~/.emacs' file:

	  (setq browse-url-browser-function 'w3m-browse-url)
	  (global-set-key "\C-xm" 'browse-url-at-point)

     Emacs-w3m will now be invoked when you type the `C-x m' key on a
     string which looks like a URL in any Emacs buffer.  In addition, you can
     use emacs-w3m to preview an HTML file that you are just editing by
     typing the `C-c C-v' key (note that you need to use Emacs and the
     `html-mode' major mode to edit the HTML file).

     If you'd like to use another web browser than emacs-w3m when using the
     `C-x m' key when you are in an emacs-w3m buffer (who wants to do
     so?), add the following advice to `~/.emacs' file:

	  (defadvice browse-url-at-point
	    (around change-browse-url-browser-function activate)
	    "Use Netscape only when it is invoked in an emacs-w3m buffer."
	    (let ((browse-url-browser-function
		   (if (eq major-mode 'w3m-mode)
		       'browse-url-netscape
		     'w3m-browse-url)))
	      ad-do-it))

   * dired

     You can use emacs-w3m to browse an HTML file in a `dired' buffer by
     typing the `C-x m' key.  Use the following settings in your
     `~/.emacs' file:

	  (eval-after-load "dired"
	    '(define-key dired-mode-map "\C-xm" 'dired-w3m-find-file))

	  (defun dired-w3m-find-file ()
	    (interactive)
	    (require 'w3m)
	    (let ((file (dired-get-filename)))
	      (if (y-or-n-p (format "Use emacs-w3m to browse %s? "
				    (file-name-nondirectory file)))
		  (w3m-find-file file))))

   * hnf-mode

     You can see the newest diary using emacs-w3m and the hyper nikki system.
     Put the following lines in your `~/.emacs' file and type the
     `C-c C-b' key in an `hnf-mode' buffer:

	  (defun w3m-hnf-browse-url-w3m (url &optional new-window)
	    (interactive (browse-url-interactive-arg "URL: "))
	    (save-selected-window
	      (pop-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*w3m*"))
	      (w3m-browse-url url new-window)))
	  (setq hnf-browse-url-browser-function #'w3m-hnf-browse-url-w3m)

   * Gnus

     You've mistaken the entrance if you are a Gnus user and this
     section is the first page you read in this Info.  See *Note
     Hooking into MUAs:: first.

     By default, Gnus will not apply the treatment variables, for
     instance `gnus-treat-strip-banner', to `text/html' parts.  To
     have them applied to `text/html' parts automatically, there are
     two ways to do that:

	  ;; Apply all the treatments to text/html parts.
	  (eval-after-load "gnus-art"
	    '(add-to-list 'gnus-article-treat-types "text/html"))

	  ;; Apply a certain treatment to text/html parts.
	  (setq gnus-treat-strip-banner '(or t (typep "text/html")))

     Also *Note Customizing Articles: (gnus)Customizing Articles, for
     details.

     In addition, the experimental code below is used to display
     `multipart/related' pictures.  The place might be something wrong.

	  (eval-after-load "gnus-art"
	    '(or (assoc "multipart/related" gnus-mime-multipart-functions)
		 (setq gnus-mime-multipart-functions
		       (cons
                        (cons
			 "multipart/related"
			 (byte-compile
			  (lambda (handle)
			    (gnus-mime-display-mixed (cdr handle)))))
                        gnus-mime-multipart-functions))))

   * yahtml-mode

     You can use emacs-w3m to preview an HTML file that just you are
     editing with the `yahtml-mode'.  Here is an example:

	  (defadvice yahtml-browse-html
	    (around w3m-yahtml-browse-html activate compile)
	    (w3m-goto-url (ad-get-arg 0) t))

   * jisx0213

     You can use JIS X 0213 character set in Emacs using the `jis0213'
     module which is bundled in the Mule-UCS package.  Although the
     `decode-char' function is overridden by `mucs' (`jis0213' loads
     `mucs') and it stops working properly for the `ucs' coded
     character set, it has been reported that also to load the
     `unicode' module seems to solve the problem. The reason has not
     been made clear yet.  Here is an example for the `~/.emacs' file:

	  (require 'unicode)
	  (require 'un-define)
	  (require 'jisx0213)

   * w3m-type-ahead.el

     The w3m-type-ahead.el package provides "type ahead" searching,
     similar to the feature by the same name from Mozilla browsers.
     It allows you to find anchors using an interface similar to
     isearch, but results are limited to anchors in the buffer.

     Download w3m-type-ahead.el from
     `http://alioth.debian.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30594'.
